{"tagline":"Easily import docs to your gh-pages branch.","google":"","body":"GitHub Pages Import\r\n===================\r\n\r\nAs part of gunicorn_, me and `Benoit Chesneau`_ have been starting to look at\r\nhow to host documentation. There's the obvious method of using GitHub_'s\r\npost-update hooks to trigger doc builds and rsync to a webserver, but we ended\r\nup wanting to try out github's hosting to make the whole interface a bit more\r\nrobust.\r\n\r\n`GitHub Pages`_ is a pretty awesome service that GitHub provides for hosting\r\nproject documentation. The only thing is that it requires a ``gh-pages`` branch\r\nthat is the site's document root. This means that keeping documentation sources\r\nin the branch with code is a bit difficult. And it really turns into a head\r\nscratcher for things like Sphinx_ that want to access documentation sources and\r\ncode sources at the same time.\r\n\r\nThen I stumbled across an interesting looking package called `github-tools`_\r\nthat looked almost like what I wanted. It was a tad complicated and more\r\ninvolved than I wanted but it gave me an idear. Why not just write a script that\r\ncan copy a directory to the ``gh-pages`` branch of the repository. This saves me\r\nfrom even having to think about the branch and everything becomes magical.\r\n\r\nThis is what ``ghp-import`` was written for.\r\n\r\n.. _gunicorn: http://www.gunicorn.com/\r\n.. _`Benoit Chesneau`: http://github.com/benoitc\r\n.. _GitHub: http://github.com/\r\n.. _`GitHub Pages`: http://pages.github.com/\r\n.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/\r\n.. _`github-tools`: http://dinoboff.github.com/github-tools/\r\n\r\nBig Fat Warning\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThis will **DESTROY** your gh-pages branch. If you love it, you'll want to take\r\nbackups before playing with this. This script assumes that gh-pages is 100%\r\nderivative. You should never edit files in your gh-pages branch by hand if\r\nyou're using this script because you will lose your work.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n::\r\n\r\n    Usage: ghp-import [OPTIONS] DIRECTORY\r\n\r\n    Options:\r\n      -m MESG     The commit message to use on the target branch.\r\n      -p          Push the branch to origin/{branch} after committing.\r\n      -r REMOTE   The name of the remote to push to. [origin]\r\n      -b BRANCH   Name of the branch to write to. [gh-pages]\r\n      -h, --help  show this help message and exit\r\n\r\nIts pretty simple. Inside your repository just run ``ghp-import $DOCS_DIR``\r\nwhere ``$DOCS_DIR`` is the path to the *built* documentation. This will write a\r\ncommit to your ``gh-pages`` branch with the current documents in it.\r\n\r\nIf you specify ``-p`` it will also attempt to push the ``gh-pages`` branch to\r\nGitHub. By default it'll just run ``git push origin gh-pages``. You can specify\r\na different remote using the ``-r`` flag.\r\n\r\nYou can specify a different branch with ``-b``. This is useful for user and\r\norganization page, which are served from the ``master`` branch.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nghp-import is distributed under the Tumbolia Public License.
