      <h1>GitHub Pages Import</h1>
<p>As part of gunicorn_, me and <code>Benoit Chesneau</code><em> have been starting to look at
how to host documentation. There's the obvious method of using GitHub</em>'s
post-update hooks to trigger doc builds and rsync to a webserver, but we ended
up wanting to try out github's hosting to make the whole interface a bit more
robust.</p>
<p><code>GitHub Pages</code><em> is a pretty awesome service that GitHub provides for hosting
project documentation. The only thing is that it requires a <code>gh-pages</code> branch
that is the site's document root. This means that keeping documentation sources
in the branch with code is a bit difficult. And it really turns into a head
scratcher for things like Sphinx</em> that want to access documentation sources and
code sources at the same time.</p>
<p>Then I stumbled across an interesting looking package called <code>github-tools</code>_
that looked almost like what I wanted. It was a tad complicated and more
involved than I wanted but it gave me an idear. Why not just write a script that
can copy a directory to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch of the repository. This saves me
from even having to think about the branch and everything becomes magical.</p>
<p>This is what <code>ghp-import</code> was written for.</p>
<p>.. <em>gunicorn: http://www.gunicorn.com/
.. </em><code>Benoit Chesneau</code>: http://github.com/benoitc
.. <em>GitHub: http://github.com/
.. </em><code>GitHub Pages</code>: http://pages.github.com/
.. <em>Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/
.. </em><code>github-tools</code>: http://dinoboff.github.com/github-tools/</p>
<h2>Big Fat Warning</h2>
<p>This will <strong>DESTROY</strong> your gh-pages branch. If you love it, you'll want to take
backups before playing with this. This script assumes that gh-pages is 100%
derivative. You should never edit files in your gh-pages branch by hand if
you're using this script because you will lose your work.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>::</p>
<pre><code>Usage: ghp-import [OPTIONS] DIRECTORY

Options:
  -m MESG     The commit message to use on the target branch.
  -p          Push the branch to origin/{branch} after committing.
  -r REMOTE   The name of the remote to push to. [origin]
  -b BRANCH   Name of the branch to write to. [gh-pages]
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
</code></pre>
<p>Its pretty simple. Inside your repository just run <code>ghp-import $DOCS_DIR</code>
where <code>$DOCS_DIR</code> is the path to the <em>built</em> documentation. This will write a
commit to your <code>gh-pages</code> branch with the current documents in it.</p>
<p>If you specify <code>-p</code> it will also attempt to push the <code>gh-pages</code> branch to
GitHub. By default it'll just run <code>git push origin gh-pages</code>. You can specify
a different remote using the <code>-r</code> flag.</p>
<p>You can specify a different branch with <code>-b</code>. This is useful for user and
organization page, which are served from the <code>master</code> branch.</p>
